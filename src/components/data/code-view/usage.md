  * #### Syntax highlight \- optional

Syntax highlighting determines the color and style of source code displayed in the code view.

    * For example, it’s responsible for colorizing keywords in JavaScript like `for`, `if`, or `const` differently than strings, comments, and numbers.

Line numbers are displayed preceding each line of code to support lines reference.

With line wrapping, users can have visibility over the source code content within the code view area by wrapping long lines of code onto new lines. When line wrapping is active, the maximum row width is the width of the code editing area in the component. Line wrapping is off by default.
