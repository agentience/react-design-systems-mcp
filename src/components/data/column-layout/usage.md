## General guidelines

### Do

  * Each column layout is independent, and is applied per content area. 
  * All the columns will stack responsively according to the container width. 
  * Use column layout when your content can be divided into sections that have a clear relationship. 
  * Content should be the drive to use column layout.



## Features

  * #### Columns

The layout of the region can have from one to four columns that behave responsively depending on the width of the container. The default layout is one column.

  * #### Borders

Borders, also called hairlines, are visual dividers to help structure the hierarchy of your content. By default, the columns don't display any border. Both vertical and horizontal borders are supported.

  * #### Variant

There are two variants of column layout:

    * **Default** – The default column layout allows you to add vertical or horizontal borders as well as removing the gutters around the columns.

    * **Text grid** – The [text-grid](/components/column-layout/?example=with-text-grids) is conceived for column layouts containing text. All spacing and borders are predefined and can't be customized. 

      * For example: [key-value pairs](/components/key-value-pairs/) on a resource detail page.
