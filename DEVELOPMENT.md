```

## Development Installation

1. Ensure you have Node.js 24.0.1 or higher installed:
```bash
node --version
# Should output v24.0.1 or higher
```

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentience/react-design-systems-mcp.git
cd react-design-systems-mcp
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Build the TypeScript code:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Development Usage

Start the server:
```bash
npm start

# With custom port
npm start -- --port 8080
# or
PORT=8080 npm start

# With custom bind address
npm start -- --bind 127.0.0.1
# or
BIND=127.0.0.1 npm start
```

For development with automatic reloading:
```bash
npm run dev

# With custom port
npm run dev -- --port 8080
# or
PORT=8080 npm run dev

# With custom bind address
npm run dev -- --bind 127.0.0.1
# or
BIND=127.0.0.1 npm run dev
```

## Core Components

The React Design Systems MCP server provides the following functionality:

- **Component Registry**: Metadata for Cloudscape components
- **Search Engine**: Search for components by name, category, or tags
- **Code Generator**: Generate code for components and common patterns
- **Documentation Provider**: Comprehensive documentation for components
- **Example Provider**: Usage examples for components
- **Property Explorer**: Detailed property information and relationships
- **Roo Integration**: Enhanced integration with Roo
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching and memoization for improved performance
- **Security Enhancements**: Input validation and sanitization
- **Remote Server Capability**: Server stays running and listens on the specified port

## Testing

Run the test scripts to verify that all components are working correctly:

```bash
# Basic test
node dist/test.js

# Phase 2 test (Component Registry and Search Engine)
node dist/test-phase2.js

# Phase 3 test (Code Generator, Documentation Provider, and Example Provider)
node dist/test-phase3.js

# Phase 4 test (Roo Integration, Performance, and Security)
node dist/test-phase4.js
```

## Implementation Phases

The React Design Systems MCP server was implemented in four phases:

### Phase 1: Initial Setup and Core Functionality

- Set up the basic MCP server infrastructure
- Implemented the Component Registry with metadata for the most commonly used components
- Implemented basic search functionality
- Implemented basic component retrieval functionality

### Phase 2: Complete Component Registry and Enhanced Search

- Completed the Component Registry with metadata for all Cloudscape components
- Enhanced search functionality with advanced filtering and ranking
- Implemented property exploration functionality
- Improved component retrieval with more detailed information

### Phase 3: Code Generation and Documentation

- Implemented code generation for individual components
- Implemented code generation for common Cloudscape patterns
- Implemented comprehensive documentation provider
- Implemented example provider

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing

- Integrated the MCP server with Roo
- Tested the integration with frontend-code mode
- Optimized performance with caching and memoization
- Implemented security enhancements with input validation and sanitization
- Finalized documentation

- `docs/phase2-summary.md`
- `docs/phase3-summary.md`
- `docs/phase4-summary.md`

## FastMCP Implementation

This project uses the FastMCP framework, which provides a more structured and type-safe approach to building MCP servers. FastMCP offers several advantages over traditional MCP implementations:

### Key Features

- **Simplified tool and resource definition**: Easier API for defining MCP tools and resources
- **Built-in support for authentication**: Streamlined authentication handling
- **Session management**: Automatic session tracking and management
- **Image and audio content handling**: Support for multimedia content types
- **Improved logging**: Enhanced logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring
- **Better error handling**: More robust error handling and reporting
- **Support for SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: Real-time communication capabilities
- **CORS support**: Built-in Cross-Origin Resource Sharing support
- **Progress notifications**: Ability to send progress updates for long-running operations
- **Typed server events**: Type-safe event handling
- **Prompt argument auto-completion**: Enhanced development experience

### Transport Types

The FastMCP server supports two transport types:

1. **stdio (default)**: Standard input/output transport for local server communication
2. **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: HTTP-based transport for web applications and remote clients

#### Running with stdio Transport

```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

#### Running with SSE Transport

```bash
npm run dev:sse
```

### Implementation Details

For detailed technical information about the FastMCP implementation, including tool and resource registration patterns, see [FastMCP Implementation Guide](docs/fastmcp-implementation.md).

## Node.js 24.x Compatibility

This project requires Node.js 24.0.1 or higher. If you encounter any issues related to the Node.js version, please refer to the [Node.js 24 Upgrade Guide](docs/nodejs-24-upgrade-guide.md) for detailed information about compatibility considerations and potential issues.

Key considerations:
- TypeScript 5.4+ is recommended for better Node.js 24 support
- Some users have reported issues with ts-node on Node.js 24
- HTTP parser changes may affect behavior in some cases

## Publishing

To publish a new version of the package:

1. Update the version in `package.json`
2. Build the package:
```bash
npm run build
```

3. Publish to npm:
```bash
npm publish
```
