## Key Decisions

* **SSE Implementation:** Use existing FastMCP framework's SSE support via similar invocation to `npm run dev:sse`
* **Docker Configuration:** Expose port 3005 in the container and map to host port 3005
* **Testing Approach:** Manual testing with a client connecting to the SSE endpoint is sufficient
* **No Authentication Required:** The SSE endpoint will not require authentication
* **No Volume Mounts Required:** The server doesn't write files during normal operation

## Blockers

* *(No blockers identified)*

## Node.js 24.0.1 Upgrade Plan

* Update package.json engines field from ">=18.0.0" to ">=24.0.0"
* Update Dockerfile from Node.js 20.11.1-alpine3.19 to 24.0.1-alpine3.20
* Update GitHub workflow files from Node.js 18.x to 24.x
* Test compatibility with dependencies (focus on fastmcp, ts-node, and TypeScript)
* Consider upgrading TypeScript to 5.4+ for better Node.js 24 support
* Test HTTP endpoints thoroughly due to HTTP parser changes in Node.js 24
* Update documentation to reflect new Node.js version requirements

## Research Findings Summary

* **Node.js 24.0.1 Compatibility**: Core dependencies (express, js-yaml, lodash, tslib) are highly compatible with Node.js 24.0.1
* **Potential Issues**: Some concerns with fastmcp compatibility, TypeScript configuration, and HTTP behavior changes
* **Docker Image**: Recommended to use node:24.0.1-alpine3.20 as the base image
* **Testing Focus**: Unit tests, integration tests, Docker build, and CI/CD pipeline
* **Documentation**: Comprehensive research findings available in docs/research/nodejs-24-compatibility.md
