# GitHub Workflow Publish Fix

## Issue
The GitHub workflow for publishing the package was failing with the error:
```
chmod: cannot access 'dist/server-fastmcp.js': No such file or directory
```

## Root Cause
The workflow was attempting to make a file named `dist/server-fastmcp.js` executable, but according to the package.json configuration, the correct file is `dist/server.js`.

## Fix
Added an explicit step in the GitHub workflow to ensure the correct server file (`dist/server.js`) is made executable:

```yaml
# Ensure the server file is executable
- name: Make server file executable
  run: chmod +x dist/server.js
```

This step is added even though the postbuild script already attempts to make the file executable, to ensure the file permissions are set correctly during the GitHub workflow execution.

## Testing
The fix will be verified by ensuring the GitHub workflow runs successfully after merging.
