# GitHub Packages Publishing Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of GitHub Packages publishing for the React Design Systems MCP package. The package is now published to both npm and GitHub Packages registries, providing users with multiple options for installation.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated GitHub Workflow**
   - Modified `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to include a new job for GitHub Packages publishing
   - Added proper configuration for GitHub Packages registry
   - Configured authentication using the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`

2. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated `docs/npm-publication-guide.md` to include GitHub Packages information
   - Updated `docs/pre-publication-checklist.md` with GitHub Packages checks
   - Added this document to record the implementation details
   - Updated `docs/project-management/workflow-state.md` with the task entry

## Implementation Details

### GitHub Workflow Configuration

The GitHub workflow now includes two separate jobs:
1. `build` - Builds the package and publishes to npm registry
2. `publish-github` - Publishes the package to GitHub Packages

The `publish-github` job:
- Runs after the `build` job completes successfully
- Uses the GitHub Packages registry URL: `https://npm.pkg.github.com/`
- Configures the scope to match the GitHub organization: `@agentience`
- Uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` for authentication

### Authentication

- For GitHub Actions: The workflow uses the automatically provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret
- For local development: Users need to configure their `.npmrc` file with a GitHub Personal Access Token

### Installation Instructions

Users can install the package from either registry:

**From npm Registry:**
```bash
npm install @agentience/react-design-systems-mcp
```

**From GitHub Packages:**
```bash
# Configure npm to use GitHub Packages for the @agentience scope
echo "@agentience:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/" >> .npmrc

# Install the package
npm install @agentience/react-design-systems-mcp
```

## Benefits

1. **Redundancy**: If one registry is unavailable, users can still install from the other
2. **Private Installation**: Organizations using GitHub Packages can install the package without needing npm access
3. **Integration**: Better integration with GitHub ecosystem and workflows
4. **Visibility**: Increased visibility of the package within the GitHub ecosystem

## Testing

The implementation has been tested by:
1. Reviewing the workflow configuration
2. Updating documentation to ensure consistency
3. Verifying that the package name matches the GitHub organization structure

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the next release to ensure successful publishing to both registries
2. Gather feedback from users on the installation experience
3. Consider adding badges to the README.md to indicate availability on both registries
